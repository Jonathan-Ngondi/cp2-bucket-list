# CP2: Bucketlist_API
 
## Introduction
This app was built using the Flask framework and it allows you to perform simple CRUD operations on a database using api endpoints. A bucketlist is a list of things one would like to accomplish before dying. This app allows a user to add, modify and delete bucketlists of their choosing as well as add, modify, and delete items pertaining to those bucketlists. This project was submitted in partial fulfillment of my Andela fellowship requirements. 
 
## Installation
 
Clone the Bucketlist_api's GitHub repo:
 
http:
>`$ git clone https://github.com/Jonathan-Ngondi/cp2-bucket-list.git`

cd into the created folder and install a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

`$ virtualenv venv`

Activate the virtual environment

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

Install all app requirements

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Create the database and run migrations

`$ python manage.py create_db [name]`

To run migrations:
`$ python manage.py db init`

`$ python manage.py db migrate`

`$ python manage.py db upgrade`

Don't forget to set your APP_SETTINGS to set your app configurations, you can choose from:
- development
- testing
- production
- staging
#e.g.
`$ export APP_SETTINGS='development`

All done! Now, start your server by running `python manage.py runserver`. For best experience, use a GUI platform like [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make requests to the api.

### Searching

It is possible to search bucketlists using the parameter `q` in the GET request. 
Example:

`GET http://localhost:/bucketlists?q=Spirituality`

This request will return all bucketlists named `Spirituality`.

### Pagination

It is possible to limit the count of bucketlist data displayed using the parameter `limit` in the GET request. 

Example:

`GET http://localhost:/api/v1/bucketlists?limit=5`

It is also possible to set the record we would like to start viewing from.

Example:

`GET http://localhost:/api/v1/bucketlists?start=5`

### Sample GET response
